# NoteHost: Free Hosting for Notion Sites!

## Using:

- Cloudflare DNS
- Cloudflare workers
- Reverse proxy implementation
- TypeScript

## Supports:

- Custom meta tags
- Page slugs
- Dark mode toggle
- Custom JS for head and body
- Custom fonts (using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/))
- Subdomain redirect (e.g. www)

<br/>

## How to use:
From a high-level, this package works by using Cloudflare workers to redirect traffic from your domain to your relevant Notion page. As such, the steps you will need to take are (1) set up your Cloudflare account and (2) apply configurations to your worker, which is done via CLI with the packaged script.

### Setup your Cloudflare account

---

1. Add your domain to Cloudflare. Make sure that DNS doesn't have `A` records for your domain and no `CNAME` alias for `www`
2. Create a new worker on Cloudflare and give it a meaningful name, e.g. `yourdomain-com-notion-proxy`
3. Keep the default example worker code, we will overwrite it anyway during deploy (see below)

### Generate your NoteHost worker

---

Go into the working directory from which you'd like to keep the script to apply the Cloudflare worker configuration and run:

```sh
npx notehost init <domain>
```

Follow the prompts to confirm your domain name and enter the requested information. You can change these settings later via the configuration file.

NoteHost will create a directory with the name of your domain. In this directory you will see the following files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ build-page-script-js-string.sh    helper script, details below
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json                      test & deploy your website, see realtime logs
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json                     types config
â”œâ”€â”€ wrangler.toml                     your Cloudflare worker config
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ _page-script-js-string.ts     generated by helper script
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts                      runs reverse proxy
    â”œâ”€â”€ page-script.js                your custom JS page script
    â””â”€â”€ site-config.ts                your domain and website config
```

Go into this directory and run

```sh
npm install
```

<br/>

### Configure your domain

---

Make sure that wrangler is authenticated with your Cloudflare account

```sh
npx wrangler login
```

1. Edit `wrangler.toml` and make sure that the `name` field matches your worker name in Cloudflare
2. Edit `site-config.ts` and set all the necessary options: domain, metadata, slugs, subdomain redirects, etc. All settings should be self explanatory, I hope ðŸ˜Š

```ts filename="src/site-config.ts"
import { NoteHostSiteConfig, googleTag } from 'notehost'
import { PAGE_SCRIPT_JS_STRING } from './_page-script-js-string'

// Set this to your Google Tag ID from Google Analytics
const GOOGLE_TAG_ID = ''

export const SITE_CONFIG: NoteHostSiteConfig = {
  domain: 'yourdomain.com',

  // Metatags, optional
  // For main page link preview
  siteName: 'My Notion Website',
  siteDescription: 'Build your own website with Notion. This is a demo site.',
  siteImage: 'https://imagehosting.com/images/preview.jpg',

  // URL to custom favicon.ico
  siteIcon: 'https://imagehosting.com/images/favicon.ico',

  // Social media links, optional
  twitterHandle: '@mytwitter',

  // Additional safety: avoid serving extraneous Notion content from your website
  // Use the value from your Notion settings => Workspace => Settings => Domain
  notionDomain: 'mydomain',

  // Map slugs (short page names) to Notion page IDs
  // Empty slug is your main page
  slugToPage: {
    '': 'NOTION_PAGE_ID',
    about: 'NOTION_PAGE_ID',
    contact: 'NOTION_PAGE_ID',
    // Hint: you can use '/' in slug name to create subpages
    'about/people': 'NOTION_PAGE_ID',
  },

  // Rewrite meta tags for specific pages
  // Use the Notion page ID as the key
  pageMetadata: {
    'NOTION_PAGE_ID': {
      title: 'My Custom Page Title',
      description: 'My custom page description',
      image: 'https://imagehosting.com/images/page_preview.jpg',
      author: 'My Name',
    },
  },

  // Subdomain redirects are optional
  // But it is recommended to have one for www
  subDomains: {
    www: {
      redirect: 'https://yourdomain.com',
    },
  },

  // The 404 (not found) page is optional
  // If you don't have one, the default 404 page will be used
  fof: {
    page: 'NOTION_PAGE_ID',
    slug: '404', // default
  },

  // Google Font name, you can choose from https://fonts.google.com
  googleFont: 'Roboto',

  // Custom CSS/JS for head and body of a Notion page
  customHeadCSS: `
  .notion-topbar {
    background: lightblue
  }`,
  customHeadJS: googleTag(GOOGLE_TAG_ID),
  customBodyJS: PAGE_SCRIPT_JS_STRING,
}
```

<br/>

### Deploy your website

---

```sh
npm run deploy
```

ðŸŽ‰ Enjoy your Notion website on your own domain! ðŸŽ‰

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to run deploy every time you update `page-script.js` or `site-config.ts`.

<br/>

### What is build-page-script-js-string.sh?

---

The file `src/page-script.js` contains an example of a page script that you can run on your Notion pages.
This example script removes tooltips from images and hides optional properties in database cards.

ðŸ”¥ This script is run in the web browser! ðŸ”¥

You can use `document`, `window` and all the functionality of a web browser to control the contents and behavior of your Notion pages.
Also, because this is a JS file, you can edit it in your code editor with syntax highlighting and intellisense!

To incorporate this script into a Notion page, NoteHost must transform the file's contents into a string. Consequently, the `build-page-script-js-string.sh` script is executed whenever you run `npm run deploy`.

So just add your JS magic to `page-script.js`, run deploy and everything else will happen automagically ðŸ˜Ž

### Logs

---

You can see realtime logs from your website by running

```sh
npm run logs
```
